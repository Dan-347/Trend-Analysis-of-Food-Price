# Trend analysis of food prices in Singaraja City from 2020 to 2023

This analysis was conducted to understand the dynamics and patterns of price changes for key food commodities in Singaraja City during the period 2020–2023. The commodities analyzed include rice, chicken eggs, granulated sugar, chicken meat, and garlic, as these five items are basic necessities for the community and are sensitive to economic and distribution changes.

The dataset contains daily prices for each commodity. Analysis was conducted using an exploratory approach to examine price developments over time, identify seasonal patterns, calculate descriptive statistics, and assess which commodities were the most stable and which were the most volatile.

## Background
Food prices are an important indicator of economic stability in a region. Significant price fluctuations can affect people's purchasing power, especially in the context of basic necessities. Local governments, businesses, and the general public need to understand how food prices move over time in order to make informed decisions. However, food price data is often only presented in tables or periodic reports without in-depth analysis of patterns, trends, and significant changes. This makes it difficult to see the big picture regarding price stability and factors that may influence it.

Therefore, exploratory analysis is needed to understand how food price trends change, whether there are certain seasons or periods that show increases/decreases, and which commodities are most sensitive to fluctuations.

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive overview of food price dynamics in Singaraja City during 2020–2023, including:
1. Analyzing price trends for each commodity over time.
2. Identifying seasonal patterns or significant changes, such as price spikes or declines.
3. Calculate descriptive statistics such as the average, maximum price, minimum price, and price frequency.
4. Assess the price stability of each commodity based on the level of fluctuation.
5. Compare price movements between commodities to see which ones are the most volatile.
6. Provide relevant insights into the local economic context and potential factors affecting price changes.
7. Analyzing correlations between commodities to determine whether price changes in one commodity are related to other commodities.

## Why This Analysis Matter
Food price trend analysis is important in:
- Monitoring regional inflation, especially in the basic necessities sector.
- Predicting potential price increases, for example ahead of major holidays, weather changes, or distribution disruptions.
- Identifying vulnerable commodities that require special attention from local governments.
- Providing data-driven recommendations for stock preparation, subsidy policies, and market interventions.
